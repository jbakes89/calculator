## Description

A calculator webpage as part of The Odin Project Foundations course.

### Things I've learned:
- How to use unicode symbols in HTML and Javascript
- This is the first time I've actually used a `grid` display

### Things to add/improve:

## TODO (updated 23rd May, 2021)
- Enable the decimal point button
- Handle numbers overflowing the screen
- Handle division by zero
    - "Okay, we're taking away zero privileges" -> hide zero button temporarily(?)
- Enable keyboard support
- Improve appearance
- Add a hidden button to rotate the calculator(?)
