# Calculator

Author: Joseph Bakes (22nd May, 2021)

## Description

A calculator webpage as part of The Odin Project Foundations course.

### Things I've learned/practised:
- How to use unicode symbols in HTML and Javascript
- This is the first time I've actually used a `grid` display
- Learned how to adapt text size/length to available width (using `window.getComputedStyle()`)
- [Will soon learn about] handling large numbers in Javascript
- [Will soon practise] how to react to keyboard input

### Things to add/improve:

## TODO (updated 24th May, 2021)
- Handle division by zero
    - Fun option: "Okay, we're taking away zero privileges" -> hide zero button temporarily(?)
    - Sensible option: "ERR: Can't divide by zero"
- Enable keyboard support
- Handle large values (research MAX_VALUE vs MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
- Improve float precision(?) 
- Improve appearance
- Add a hidden button to rotate the calculator(?)
